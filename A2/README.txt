    - rateProduct() in ECommerceSystem rates product with comment
    - printByRating() in ECommerceSystem prints all products with the minimum user given rating
    - All product objects have 'rating' field. 'numberOfReviews' field is just to help calculate the new ratings.
    - Comments are stores in 'reviews' field. I've used an array consisting 5 arraylists. (The first arraylist holds the comments with
    1 star rating. The last arraylist holds the comments with 5 star rating.
